# python_oxygen_sensor
Python library to manipulate seeedstudio dissolved oxygen sensor
The use of this library assumes that you can communicate with the sensor 
trougth the computer's serial port. To do so you can either use a USB->RS485 converter
or a microcontroller programmed as passthrougth (with a ttl->RS485 converter)
The sensor has to be powered with 12V (12->24V)
